# About this Project
Imagine a situation where an Insurance Company is receiving tons of request from its cutomer for their claims. In such situation they dont have much time to go through each and every application for checking if its a false claim or not.

Main focus is to reduce the workload by 20-30% and focus on customers or other queries.

Using power of Machine Learning algorithms following project titled Insurance Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning was able to be sucessfull.
